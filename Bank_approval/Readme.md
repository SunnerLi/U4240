Abstract
------------------------
The problem is referred by the ppt of the machine learning class. Moreover, it's a classical problem in ML. I solve the problem by Tensorflow package. The structure is 2-hidden layer perceptron. The loss function is measure by sigmoid cross entropy, and use SGD to optimize the parameter. The result is shown above.
