# Multi-class Classification

##  Abstract    
This small project can generate the random data point first. Next, I provide one-versus-all algorithm and one-versus-one algorithm to divide the group. You can try by yourself.      
<br/>
At final, I try to validate the training set that check if the whole data are divide correctly. You can see the log file to see the detail. The divide result is shown at last of the log file.    
<br/>
## Usage
1. ```python dataProduce.py``` to generate the dataset    
2. run ovo.py or ova.py
