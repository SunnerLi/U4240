# Bounding Function

Abstract    
---------------------------
This program show the bounding function toward the specific N and K. The N and K is the input of the bounding function which were defined by the professor. The result would must less than 2^N.     
Notice! This program just use the brute-force to solve the problem. I know it can solve by DP as the professor mentioned.

Data Limit    
---------------------------
* N should be larger than K, or exception would occur
