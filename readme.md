introduction
-----------------
I engage in the class, machine learning foundation, which is launch by the professor hsuan-tien Lin. This project contains the whole homework and code that I had done in this class. Since the coursera platform closed the video and homework in the summer of 2016, I cannot participate this course in the coursera platform and get the more formal evidence. I also have the note record of the whole 16 lessons. If you are interested in too, contact me to get it by email.         
<br/>
In this project, there is not only implementation of machine learning but also some code and research of deep learning. The additional part includes the word embedded homework.     

Thanks
