### Perceptron Learning Algorithm

</br>

Abstract    
-------------------------    
This small program simulate the bank operation. We assume there're three factor which would effect the bank to give the credit. At the meantime, the bank collect the 30 custom's data. This program would get the result first. Next, we use .csv data to train the perceptron module. At last, we give the user chance to test the trained module.

Data Limit    
-------------------------    
* The year is the custom's age which is in the range between 20 and 60
* The salary is in the range between 10000 and 110000
* The gender has two type of data (male and female). Male is 1 and female is -1
